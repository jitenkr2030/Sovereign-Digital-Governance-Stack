# CSIC Platform License Agreement

## Crypto State Infrastructure Contractor (CSIC) Platform

**Sovereign Infrastructure License Version 1.0**

---

## Preamble

This License Agreement governs the use of the Crypto State Infrastructure Contractor (CSIC) Platform, a sovereign-grade infrastructure solution designed for government deployment. The CSIC Platform represents a significant investment in national digital infrastructure capabilities and is provided under terms that reflect its strategic importance, national security implications, and the unique requirements of government regulatory operations.

This is not a standard open-source license. The CSIC Platform is developed specifically for government use, and its deployment involves matters of national economic security, financial system integrity, and regulatory sovereignty. This license ensures that the platform serves its intended public purpose while protecting the interests of the state and its citizens.

By obtaining, installing, or using the CSIC Platform, the Licensee acknowledges and agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If the Licensee does not agree to these terms, the Licensee must not use the CSIC Platform and must immediately return or destroy all copies of the Platform and related materials.

The Licensor retains ownership of the Platform and all intellectual property rights therein, subject to the limited usage rights granted to Licensees under this Agreement.

**"Deployment"** means the installation, configuration, and operational activation of the Platform on computing infrastructure owned, controlled, or leased by the Licensee. Deployment includes all activities necessary to make the Platform functional for its intended regulatory purposes.

**"Authorized Personnel"** means individuals who are employees, contractors, or agents of the Licensee and who have been explicitly authorized by the Licensee to access, operate, maintain, or support the Platform. Authorized Personnel must be subject to appropriate background verification and security clearances as determined by the Licensee's security policies.

**"Sovereign Territory"** means the geographic territory under the legal jurisdiction of the Licensee government. For federal or multi-state entities, Sovereign Territory encompasses all geographic areas within the Licensee's constitutional or legal authority.

## Article 2: Grant of License

### Section 2.1 - Scope of Authorization

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

The Licensee may deploy, install, configure, and operate the Platform within Sovereign Territory on infrastructure that is owned, controlled, or exclusively leased by the Licensee. The Licensee may permit Authorized Personnel to access and use the Platform for the purpose of performing governmental regulatory functions, including but not limited to monitoring cryptocurrency activities, enforcing financial regulations, conducting compliance investigations, generating regulatory reports, and supporting law enforcement activities with appropriate legal authorization.

The Licensee may create Derivative Works for the purpose of adapting the Platform to local requirements, integrating with national systems, implementing additional regulatory features, or improving Platform functionality. However, all such Derivative Works remain subject to the terms of this Agreement and must be offered back to the Licensor for potential inclusion in the official Platform release.

The Licensee may make reasonable numbers of copies of the Platform for the purposes of backup, disaster recovery, testing, and development, provided that all copies are maintained under the Licensee's secure control and that no copy is transferred to any party other than Authorized Personnel.

### Section 2.2 - Authorization Limitations

The license granted under this Agreement is subject to explicit limitations that the Licensee acknowledges and accepts. The Licensee may not use the Platform for any purpose other than governmental regulatory functions as explicitly authorized in writing by the Licensor. Commercial use, for-profit operations, or any use that generates direct revenue from the Platform is prohibited without separate commercial licensing arrangements.

The Licensee may not sublicense, sell, lease, rent, or otherwise transfer the Platform or any portion thereof to any third party without the prior written consent of the Licensor. This prohibition extends to any arrangement that would allow a non-governmental entity to benefit from the Platform's capabilities.

The Licensee may not deploy the Platform outside of Sovereign Territory without explicit written authorization from the Licensor. Any cross-border deployment must comply with applicable data localization laws, security requirements, and international agreements governing the exchange of financial regulatory information.

The Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Platform, except to the extent explicitly permitted by applicable law and then only after providing reasonable advance notice to the Licensor and receiving acknowledgment of such activities.

## Article 3: Intellectual Property Rights

### Section 3.1 - Ownership and Reservation

The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Licensor is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Platform, including all intellectual property rights therein. This ownership encompasses copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, design rights, database rights, and all other proprietary rights whether registered or unregistered.

The license granted under this Agreement does not constitute a transfer of ownership. The Licensee obtains only a limited right to use the Platform as expressly permitted herein, and all other rights are expressly reserved by the Licensor. The Licensee may not claim any ownership interest in the Platform or any component thereof.

### Section 3.2 - Derivative Works Ownership

Any Derivative Works created by the Licensee shall be owned by the Licensee, provided that such ownership is subject to the perpetual, royalty-free license granted to the Licensor to use, modify, incorporate, and distribute such Derivative Works. The Licensor may use Derivative Works created by any Licensee to improve the Platform for all Licensees without compensation or attribution, though the Licensor may acknowledge significant contributions at its discretion.

The Licensee shall document all Derivative Works and provide the Licensor with reasonable access to documentation, source code (if applicable), and technical specifications upon request. This documentation requirement enables the Licensor to assess the value of incorporating Derivative Works into the official Platform release.

### Section 3.3 - Trademark and Branding

The Licensee may use the "CSIC Platform" name, logo, and associated branding solely to identify the Platform as the source of regulatory capabilities. The Licensee may not use the Licensor's trademarks, service marks, or branding in any manner that suggests endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation beyond the licensing relationship established herein.

The Licensee may develop its own branding for regulatory operations that incorporate the Platform, provided that such branding clearly distinguishes the Licensee's governmental identity from the underlying Platform technology.

## Article 4: Data Sovereignty and Privacy

### Section 4.1 - Data Localization Requirement

All data processed, stored, or generated by the Platform during the Licensee's operations shall remain within Sovereign Territory.

This data localization requirement extends to all categories of data, including but not limited to transaction records, regulatory reports, audit logs, user credentials, system configurations, and any derived analytical results. The Licensee is solely responsible for ensuring that all data handling practices comply with applicable national and international requirements.

The Licensee shall not use the Platform to conduct mass surveillance, conduct unauthorized monitoring, or otherwise infringe upon the privacy rights of individuals beyond what is authorized by applicable law and necessary for legitimate regulatory purposes.

### Section 4.3 - Third-Party Data Processing

If the Licensee engages third-party service providers to operate, maintain, or support the Platform, such providers must be subject to contractual obligations that ensure data protection, confidentiality, and security measures at least as stringent as those required under this Agreement. The Licensee shall remain fully responsible for the actions and omissions of any such third-party providers.

# Compliance Mapping

## Regulatory Landscape

The compliance mapping framework establishes the relationship between SDGS capabilities and the regulatory requirements that govern platform operations. This framework ensures that platforms operate within legal authorization while maximizing the value that technology can provide for governance objectives. Compliance mapping is not a one-time exercise but an ongoing function that adapts to regulatory evolution and platform development.

The regulatory landscape for state digital infrastructure spans multiple domains including financial regulation, data protection, privacy, national security, and administrative law. Each domain imposes specific requirements on how platforms can collect, process, store, and share information. The compliance mapping framework identifies these requirements, translates them into technical and operational controls, and verifies that controls are effective.

Regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction and evolve over time as legislatures respond to changing circumstances and courts interpret applicable laws. The framework includes processes for monitoring regulatory developments and adapting platform controls accordingly. This regulatory monitoring function ensures that platforms remain in compliance as the legal framework evolves.

International dimensions add complexity to compliance requirements. Platforms may interact with foreign entities, process data with international dimensions, or be subject to international agreements. The framework addresses these international considerations while maintaining the sovereignty principles that underlie SDGS design.
